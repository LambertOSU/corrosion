# Weathering Simulations

This repository contains a collection of corrosion simulations.

The corrosion of a zinc plate is modeled using hourly weather data from the NOAA.

#### Data

The hourly data sets can be found here.

#### Simulations

1. <b>zinc_corrosion_experiment.ipynb</b>

    Runs a two year simulation for a specified location.  Calculates a basic mass-action rate of corrosion and runoff resulting from weather conditions pulled from an SQL hourly measurements from the NOAA.  Plots and reports results.
